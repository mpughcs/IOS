# IOS Final Project
## Overview
In this project, I will be creating a mobile application that will help users keep track of their medications. The app will allow users to add Medications, view expenses, and delete medications. The app will also allow users to view a pictoral representation of their medications. The app was developed solo using Swift and Xcode.

## Design

I used Adobe XD to refine my idea for the app. I created a wireframe and a storyboard to help me visualize the app. 

My final implimentation of this prototyped screen is pictured below:

## Views
The app has 4 views:

### Add Medication
    This view allows users to add a medication. The user can enter the name of the medication, the shape, the frequency, and the color. The user can then click the "Add Medication" button to add the medication to the list of medications.
